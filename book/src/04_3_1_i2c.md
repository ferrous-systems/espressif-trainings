## I2C Sensor Reading Exercise 

In this excercise you will learn how to read out sensors on the i2c protocol. 
 
 
The board has two sensors that can be read via the I2C bus: `


| Peripheral                | Part number  | Reference                                                                   | Crate | Address |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|
| IMU                       | ICM-42670-P  | [Datasheet](https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/icm-42670-p-datasheet/) | [Link](https://crates.io/crates/icm42670)   | 0x68 |
| Temperature and Humidity  | SHTC3        | [Datasheet](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors/digital-humidity-sensor-shtc3-our-new-standard-for-consumer-electronics/)            | [Link](https://crates.io/crates/shtcx)       | 0x70 |


 The task is to use an existing driver from crates.io to read out the temperature and humidity sensor over i2c. After that, a second sensor will be read out over the same i2c bus using `shared-bus`. The driver for the second sensor is available locally in `common/`.

### Part 1: Reading Temperature & Humidity

Create an instance of the of the Humidity sensor SHTC3 and read and print the values for humidity and temperature every 600 ms.

#### Expected Output:

```
TEMP: [local temperature] °C
HUM: [local humidity] %
```

`i2c-sensor-reading/solution/src/main.rs` contains a working solution.

`i2c-sensor-reading/exercise/src/main.rs` contains skeleton code, that already contains necessary imports for this part. 

#### Steps:

✅ Go to the `i2c-sensor-reading/exercise/` folder and open the relevant documentation with the following command:
  
```
$ cargo doc --open
```
 
✅ Define two pins, one as SDA and one as SCL. Use them to create an Instance of the I²C peripheral. 

| Signal     | GPIO        |
|------------|-------------|
| SDA        | GPIO10      |
| SCL        | GPIO8       |



✅ Use the `shtcx` driver crate, make an instance of the SHTC3 sensor passing the I²C instance into them. Check the documentation for guidance. 

✅ Make a measurement, and read the sensor values and print them. Check the documentation for guidance on sensor methods. 

❗ Some sensors need some time to pass, between measurement and reading value. 
❗ Watch out for the expected units!



`i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` contains working code. Running it without modifying the driver file will yield errors. 

`i2c-driver/solution/src/imc42670p.rs` provides a solution to the task. 


## Hints

* There are methods that turn the sensor values into the desired unit. 

### Part 2: Reading Accelerometer data. 

Now, we want to read out the second sensor.



 `i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` contains working code skeleton. 

`i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` contains working code. Running it without modifying the driver file will yield errors. 

`i2c-driver/solution/src/imc42670p.rs` provides a solution to the task.
